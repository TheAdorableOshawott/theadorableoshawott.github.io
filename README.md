# theadorableoshawott.github.io
This is my personal website where I will host all my work and some other
things in there. Currently, it is hosted in Neocities under the domain:
https://theadorableoshawott.neocities.org

This github.io instance is meant to be an overhaul of the main Neocities site,
but this will be used as the main source for all the resources needed, such
as images and fonts, to reduce Neocities' bandwidth usage.
